# TechWayFit.Licensing.Management.Core Documentation

## Overview

The **TechWayFit.Licensing.Management.Core** project provides the foundational domain models and service contracts for an enterprise-grade software licensing management system. This core library defines the business entities, service interfaces, and supporting models required for comprehensive license lifecycle management.

## Architecture

This project follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles with a clean architecture approach:

- **Models**: Domain entities organized by business context
- **Contracts**: Service interfaces defining business operations
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between different business domains

## Domain Models

| Domain | Models | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **License** | `ProductLicense`, `LicenseStatus` | Core license entities with status management |
| **Product** | `EnterpriseProduct`, `ProductTier`, `ProductFeature` | Product hierarchy and feature management |
| **Consumer** | `ConsumerAccount`, `ContactPerson`, `Address` | Customer account and contact management |
| **Common** | `Version`, `ValidationResult` | Shared utilities and validation |
| **Report** | 11+ report models | Comprehensive reporting and analytics |
| **Notification** | `NotificationTemplate`, `NotificationPreferences` | Notification system models |

## Service Contracts

| Service | Purpose | Key Operations |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **IProductLicenseService** | License lifecycle management | Generate, validate, activate, renew, revoke |
| **IConsumerAccountService** | Customer account management | CRUD, status management, relationship queries |
| **IEnterpriseProductService** | Product management | Product lifecycle, versioning, status management |
| **IProductTierService** | Product tier management | Tier operations and feature associations |
| **IProductFeatureService** | Feature management | Feature CRUD and usage statistics |
| **ICryptographicService** | Security operations | Key generation, signing, encryption |
| **IAuditService** | Audit logging | Comprehensive audit trail management |
| **INotificationService** | Notification delivery | Template-based notifications and preferences |
| **IReportingService** | Reporting & analytics | Report generation, scheduling, export |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 or later
- Understanding of Domain-Driven Design principles
- Enterprise licensing concepts

### Integration
1. Reference the `TechWayFit.Licensing.Management.Core` project
2. Implement the service interfaces in your infrastructure layer
3. Configure dependency injection for the service contracts
4. Utilize the domain models in your business logic

## Design Patterns Used

### **Repository Pattern**
Service interfaces abstract data access allowing for flexible implementations.

### **Request/Response Pattern**
License operations use dedicated request objects instead of direct domain model manipulation.

### **Validation Pattern**
Comprehensive validation with detailed `ValidationResult` objects.

### **Audit Pattern**
Built-in audit trail support across all business operations.

### **Strategy Pattern**
Flexible reporting with multiple export formats and grouping options.

## Security Considerations

### **Cryptographic Isolation**
- `ICryptographicService` is restricted to internal use by `IProductLicenseService`
- No direct cryptographic operations allowed from external services
- Centralized security control through license service layer

### **Audit Requirements**
- All operations include audit trail support
- User tracking for all modifications
- Reason codes for status changes and critical operations

### **Data Protection**
- Validation at service boundaries
- Secure property management for sensitive data
- Proper encryption patterns for license keys

## Contributing

When extending this core library:
1. Follow the established naming conventions
2. Include comprehensive XML documentation
3. Maintain async patterns throughout
4. Add appropriate validation for new operations
5. Ensure audit trail support for new entities
6. Update this documentation for new features
