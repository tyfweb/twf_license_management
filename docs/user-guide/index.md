## Overview

The TechWayFit License Management System provides comprehensive tools for managing software licenses throughout their lifecycle. This guide covers all user-facing functionality from basic operations to advanced workflows.

## User Roles

The system supports multiple user roles with different permissions:

| Role | Permissions | Description |

| **Consumer Manager** | Consumer operations | Manages consumer accounts and their license assignments |
| **Read-Only User** | View permissions | Can view data but cannot make changes |

## Core Concepts

### Products
Software applications or services that require licensing. Each product can have:
- Multiple versions
- Different licensing models (perpetual, subscription, trial)
- Feature-based licensing tiers
- Custom validation rules

### Licenses
Individual license instances that grant usage rights for specific products:
- Cryptographically signed for security
- Tied to specific consumers or organizations
- Include validity periods and usage restrictions
- Support various license models

### Consumers
Organizations or individuals who purchase and use licenses:
- Complete contact and billing information
- Multiple licenses across different products
- Usage tracking and reporting
- Support ticket integration

### Tenants
Organizational boundaries that provide data isolation:
- Separate customer organizations
- Independent user management
