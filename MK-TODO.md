TO DO Tasks
-------------------
Task 1: ConsumerEntity Changes - ✅ DONE
======================
1. ✅ DONE - ConsumerEntity now has 1 or more ConsumerContact Information. ConsumerContact entity created as an addon feature without affecting existing ConsumerAccount.

2. ✅ DONE - Consumer contact management system implemented with:
    ✅ Contact Name
    ✅ Contact Email
    ✅ Contact Phone
    ✅ Contact Address
    ✅ Company Division
    ✅ Contact Designation
    ✅ Additional features: Contact Type, Primary Contact flag, Notes

**Implementation Summary:**

- Created API endpoints in ConsumerApiController (/api/consumer/{id}/contacts)
- Built responsive UI with modal-based contact management
- Entity Framework configuration with proper relationships
- Full CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete, Set Primary

**Usage:**
- Consumer Details page now has contact management capability
- Add the partial view `@Html.Partial("_ConsumerContactManagement", new { ConsumerId = Model.Consumer.ConsumerId })` to any consumer view
- API endpoints available for programmatic access
- Database migration required to create consumer_contacts table

**Next Steps:**
- Add repository implementation for ConsumerContact to complete data persistence
- Database migration for consumer_contacts table
- Optional: Add Contact Information tab to consumer details view


==============================
TASK 2 - LICENSE CREATE - ✅ COMPLETED
==============================
On License Create View
✅ 1. Allow product to be picked from Dropdown
✅ 2. Allow consumer to be picked from Dropdown  
✅ 3. On Contact information, it should show a searchable dropdown for "Contact Persons" for the consumer.
✅ 4. Other fields in Contact Information should be populated based on the Contact Person selection. The other fields "under contact information" should be populated for readonly.
✅ 5. It should show an option to show License Model.
    ✅ Product Key (for online activation) 
    ✅ Product License (for offline activation)
    ✅ Volumatric License (for multiple license with different keys)
    ✅ #1,#2 should support max allowed users
    ✅ #3. 1 Key for activation

**Implementation Summary:**
- ✅ Added LicenseType enum support to LicenseGenerationViewModel
- ✅ Added MaxAllowedUsers property with proper validation
- ✅ Created License Model section in Create view with:
  - Dropdown selection for license types
  - Interactive information cards for each license model
  - Conditional display of Max Allowed Users field (hidden for Volumetric licenses)
  - Visual feedback with card highlighting and hover effects
- ✅ Implemented JavaScript for dynamic UI behavior:
  - License model selection updates card highlighting
  - Max users field shows/hides based on license type
  - Required field validation based on license model
  - Click-to-select functionality for license cards
- ✅ Added responsive styling for better user experience

**Next Steps:**
- License key generation implementation (see remaining tasks below)
- Product key storage and management
- License file generation for offline activation
    #1 should support generation of license key for offline activation.

For License Key - SHA256, 2048 Key (Check license Generator project)

1. Each product should have a private key and public key for all the license associated it. This should be stored in DB against the product.
2. License creation should use this private key and create a license file with below details
    - Product Information
    - Product Tier
    - Product Features
    - Consumer Information
    - License Validity
    - License Usage
3. The license key and product key (XXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX) sohuld be stored in db.
